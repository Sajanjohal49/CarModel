    description:"The Maxima is one of the quicker full-size sedans, and its V-6 engine sounds good when it's pushed hard. The 3.5-liter V-6 makes 300 horsepower and moves the Maxima along with purpose. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), however, detracts from the Maxima's sports-sedan mission. In our testing, a Maxima Platinum sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds, out accelerating rivals such as the Volkswagen Arteon and V-6-powered models of the Charger. The Maxima handles well for its size. The suspension is nicely damped and firm to the point of being perhaps too stiff for the class. The Maxima exhibits little body lean in aggressive cornering maneuvers, and in our testing, the Maxima SR easily outhandled its rivals.",

    description:"Under the hood of all Murano models is a 3.5-liter V-6 making 260 horsepower. Front-wheel drive is standard, but all-wheel drive can be added to any trim, and both setups utilize a CVT. The last Murano we tested had decent performance on our test track and delivered peppy performance around town. Bury your foot in the throttle—an exercise few Murano buyers will do frequently—and the CVT spikes the engine revs and holds them there, resulting in a loud, droning growl from under the hood. The Murano is in its element on long-distance highway jaunts, where the powertrain fades into the background and delivers a peaceful journey. With a suspension tuned for comfort, the Murano makes easy work of road trips, and its suspension damps out even the roughest potholes to deliver a smooth ride. Encounter a twisty road and the Murano will safely deliver you to the next intersection, but it won't entertain you along the way. The steering delivers good highway stability but is dull and uncommunicative on meandering two-lanes. The Murano offers a low tow rating of 1500 pounds.",
